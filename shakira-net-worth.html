Shakira is a singer, songwriter, musician, choreographer, model, and a record producer, .</p><p>So just how rich is Shakira? Shakira’s net worth is estimated by reputable sources to be an impressive $220 million (2015), which she has accumulated mostly from her very successful singing career which has so far spanned 25 years.</p><h3>Shakira Net Worth $220 Million</h3><p>Shakira loved music from an early age, and started by writing poems which developed into songs, such that when she rose to fame in the 1990s, primarily in Colombia and Latin America, with the release of her debut album “Magia” in 1990 at the age of 13, it contained songs she had written during previous years. Her second album was released in 1993, but these first two were only moderately successful commercially, then in 1996, Shakira produced and released her third studio album entitled “Pies Descalzos” (translated as “Bare Feet”), which peaked at #3 on the US Billboard Latin Pop Albums and was certified platinum by RIAA. The album was followed by a 20 show tour, and in 1997 received three Billboard Latin Music Awards. Shakira then released her fourth studio album “Dónde Están los Ladrones?” that proved to be commercially successful as well, peaking at #131 on the Billboard 200. The album was well received by critics and the audience, selling a total of sevn million copies worldwide. Such a remarkable start in the music industry added a substantial amount to Shakira’s net worth.</p><p>In the early 2000s, Shakira switched to English-speaking audiences and released her first English-language album “Laundry Service” that peaked at #3 on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 200,000 copies during its first week. The lead single of the album entitled “Whenever, Wherever” became Shakira’s first internationally successful song. To date, Shakira has released 10 commercially successful studio albums. Her most recent endeavor is a self-titled album released in 2014 that debuted at #2 on the US Billboard chart and sold over 84,000 copies during its first week.</p><p>In addition to her music career, Shakira has also appeared in several TV series, including “Ugly Betty”, “Taina”, “Wizards of Waverly Place”, besides guesting on “Saturday Night Live”.</p><p>Shakira is equally well-known for her philanthropic work, and actively partakes in various charity events. In 1997, Shakira founded the Colombian charity “Barefoot Foundation” (Pies Descalzos Foundation), which aids poor children through education, and has so far established five special schools around Colombia. Shakira is also a member of the ALAS Foundation, which is a non-profit organization founded by Latin-American artists and business leaders, and is also aimed at helping children. Among other recognitions, Shakira served as the Honorary Chairperson for “Action Week”, was honored as a guest at Oxford University, awarded a medal by the UN International Labor Organization and, in 2011, was chosen as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year for her philanthropic contributions. During her career, Shakira has received 360 nominations and won a total of 234 awards, including Billboard Latin Music Awards, Grammy Awards, MTV Awards, Teen Choice Awards and Billboard Music Awards among many others.</p><p>In her personal life, Shakira was in a decade-long relationship with Antonio de la Rua – an Argentinian lawyer –&nbsp; which ended somewhat acrimoniously in 2010 with Rua subsequently claiming a significant share of Shakira’s wealth, allegedly earned as her business manager. Currently Shakira resides in Barcelona, Spain with Gerard Piqué, a Spanish football player for FC Barcelona, and their two sons.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Shakira</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$220 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 2, 1977</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>August 3, 2016, Pembroke Pines, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Barranquilla, Colombia</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 1 in (1.57 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>120 lbs (54.5 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Singer-songwriter, Musician, Dancer, Choreographer, Model, Entrepreneur, Philanthropist</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of California, Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Colombia</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Milan Piqué Mebarak, Sasha Piqué Mebarak</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Nidia del Carmen Ripoll Torrado, William Mebarak Chadid</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Tonino Mebarak, Antonio Mebarak, Edward Mebarak, Lucy Mebarak, Patricia Mebarak, Alberto Mebarak, Moises Mebarak, Ana Mebarak, Robin Mebarak, Chantaje, La Bicicleta, Waka Waka – K-Mix</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Gerard Piqué (2010–)</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll , Shakira Mebarak , Shakira Ripoll , Shakira Mebarak Ripoll , Shaki , Mebarak</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/shakira</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.twitter.com/shakira</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/shakira</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>http://www.myspace.com/shakira</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0787680</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year, Latin Grammy Award for Song of the Year, Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year, Lo Nuestro Award for Artist of the Year, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Female, MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography, Gram…</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Pop, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song, Lo Nuestro Award for Collaboration of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video, MTV Vi…</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Zootopia, Alice’s Birthday, Shakira: Live and Off the Record, Shakira: Laundry Service – Washed and Dried</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Voice, El oasis, El Club de Los Tigritos</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=trademarks><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Distinctive singing voice</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Wavy blonde hair</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Frequently wears tight clothes.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Sexy dance moves</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Her dancing hips</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Performs barefoot in most of her concerts</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=quotes><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>[When asked if she told her boyfriend, Gerard Piqué, about the video concept of her song with Rihanna, “Can’t Remember to Forget You”] I asked him if he agreed with everything and he agreed. I wanted to make sure because he’s super-jealous. He’s territorial. He wants to know everything is under control.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I don’t obsess on my flaws because I see my body as a whole. Besides, I think men appreciate confidence more than perfection.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I think, if you can prove the existence of God, it can only be proven through love. I even had lost my faith for a while… I started to think that there was no God. And suddenly, I meet Gerard [Piqué] and the sun comes out.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I love chocolate. I’m addicted to it. Do you know when I realized that? Shortly before we started shooting the video for “She Wolf”. I needed a whole month to get back into shape. I danced, worked out and had to stick to a strict diet – only fish, spinach and a specially-prepared dessert with tofu. For the first time in my life, I was dreaming of chocolate and cake and always woke up with tears in my eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I couldn’t strip naked. Maybe when I’m 40, I will change my mind. Around 10 years ago, I couldn’t imagine putting on a skin-tight body suit and high heels and dancing in a golden cage, hanging upside down from the bars. Today, I’m saying I’ll never show myself naked. Our opinions change all the time.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I don’t like the competition part of soccer. It’s a war in short pants. I prefer art.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I prefer an ugly truth to a pretty lie. If someone is telling me the truth that is when I will give my heart.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>I’m not a model for anyone and the truth is, I never even tried a hit of pot. I’m not saying that I’ve never ever felt curious, but I feel that if I were doped up I would not even be able to smell, or eat, or breathe, or sing. And I don’t want to start using crutches when I know that I can walk. Drug addiction is a loss of freedom.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Technology scares me. We live surrounded by a battalion of sounds, engaged in ostentatious displays of new recording techniques. But, to me, the fundamental essence of a song lies in the melody and the lyrics.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Every single project, it doesn’t matter how big it is or how small it is, we take it with the same interest and the same enthusiasm, and we make the same effort. I feel the exact thing before I sing on Saturday Night Live (1975) as when I sang on a very small television show in Colombia. Before the first singing contest I ever participated in, I felt the same nervousness I feel now. So part of me gets bigger and keeps evolving, but at the end of the day, you end up feeling the same things.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>One of the ways I grew up was through the loss of people close to me. The person who was my closest friend and who managed me for five years, Patricia Tellez, died suddenly from a blood clot. The other friend, a friend from Barranquilla, died from cancer and she was only 33. She left three children.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>[on death] I always tried not to touch that subject, because it would really give me existential anxiety. Death is not only related to the physical death of the body, it’s also related to the death of relationships or feelings. Every day, I feel a little bit older, a little less alive, more alive with the possibility of being less alive, closer to death.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>In some moment, I came to fall into the claws of moralism. Something very typical for a Latin-American woman, who has lived in a culture of repression. I thought I had all the answers, I was full of hasty judgments. Today, I feel more liberated and open. I’m more tolerant. I respect ideas different to mine. Moralism is a disease. It shouldn’t be exactly related to religion, – but it is true that my view of religion has also changed lately.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>I was born close to the ocean and live close to it. I spent all my Sundays on the ocean, and to me it will always be a magical place. I can always find different memories in my head, but special moments were on the ocean or staring at the sea – falling in love, playing, or just talking to myself. It kind of seduces you. But lately I’ve been fearing it a little bit because of the sharks, the attacks, you know? But then again, they were there first.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>In any woman’s life, there’s a moment when we stand in front of a mirror and we’re not happy. It might be when we’re 32 and we think about what it will be like being 36, or when we’re 36 we might think of being younger. We’re never content with the way we are and the way we look. But if you start loving yourself the way you are, and accepting yourself the way you are, your outlook totally changes.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>For several years, I worried a lot about protecting an image, but today, I have understood that the image cannot be preconceived.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>My celebrity arrived gradually, and this is why I am not too much shocked or am not traumatised. In spite of that, I am always surprised when I see myself on television.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>I always believed that women have rights and that there are some women that are intelligent enough to claim those rights. There are some others that are stupid enough not to. It is as cut-and dried as that. It doesn’t matter if you are a woman or not; in this life, to earn your place you have to fight for it.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>When you fall in love, you prioritize everything. It’s like cleaning up and putting things in place.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>I want to learn how to live in the present with my eyes open. Because, you know, we always go through the present blindfolded with our hearts in the past and our minds in the future. And that way we never enjoy the here and now.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Nationalism is cured by traveling</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>I think in every artist’s life, when, right after a performance, we get to feel a certain loneliness and solitude. After receiving so much attention and love from your fans, suddenly everything stops.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>I guess there’s many ways to become an enlightened human being, but I guess the shortest path is always through love. And the shortest path to becoming a better person is always through loving someone. If you don’t know how to treat the ones that you love then how are you going to treat those that you don’t know, or those who are your enemies?</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>The industry is a bit more visual oriented (more) towards something to the eyes than something to the ears, That’s a bit of a contradiction. We can’t forget that, at the end of the day, what really matters here is music. I must confess that sometimes I have been a victim of that.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>I certainly don’t want to identify with Cinderella, she had a dream that lasted only until midnight. I want it to last until at least 3 a.m.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>My belly dancing represents me – it’s a trademark. I’ve tried to incorporate it in original ways in modern songs. But sometimes, it bugs me a bit that people resort to (saying) that I’m shaking my ass with a huge sexual charge, instead of recognizing it as a move that, yeah, it’s loaded with sensuality, but it’s also part of an artistic expression.</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>I do feel that there is a difference between – especially the visual part – what I used to do in Latin America and what I do now. This album (Laundry Service) came out and all of a sudden I saw myself surrounded by 20 stylists, makeup artists, hairdressers, directors, assistant to the director, assistant to the assistant to the director. I try to be in control because some of your essence kind of gets a little hurt. That’s why it’s so important for me to do these live shows. On the stage, there’s no tricks, there’s no way to fool anybody, so you either like what you see or you hate it, that’s it. It’s just the bare truth.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Colombia is a country of victims, and not of murderers.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>I’ve gone through everything with the paparazzi, where they are even hanging from the trees trying to get a picture. But I have a wonderful relationship with the press. I don’t feel mistreated. There is great communication between me and the media, and that makes me feel so lucky because I see how an artist can suffer. But I also live a life a journalist would find very boring. I’ve been dating the same guy for six years. I’m not a party animal, and you never see me shopping because I hate shopping.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Of course, I am trying to make my accent not bother anyone, but I am not going to drive myself crazy trying to pretend I am an American girl when I am from Colombia.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>I am a pop star, but I also have an opinion. I grew up in a country that has existed under the whip of violence for 40 years, so how can I not? You know in my country, a 5-year-old knows not only of Disney and Mickey Mouse but of guerrillas and paramilitaries. You grow up with that kind of awareness, of what the world is really like. To be political in my country doesn’t mean you want to run for presidency, to be political simply means to have an opinion</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Earlier I tried not to show my stomach, because I thought it wasn’t perfect and I would have seemed fat. I would have died! But that does not bother me anymore. Like my dad says there is nothing more beautiful than some meat on the bones.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>I had my first boyfriend when I was 12, and my parents knew about it. My dad was very jealous. I had an older sister in medical school, and he would not let her wear tight jeans.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>I never went through an adolescence when kids become rebels and do drugs. I was always the good girl.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>A bed is still the first thing I look for when I have 20 free minutes. I still read a book if I have a free hour, and go to a movie if I have four.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>When I perform, I find myself exorcised of everything that keeps me trapped in my everyday life.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>I cannot expect that I will be successful my whole life. We live so caught up in the moment, it’s important to get some perspective. Ultimately, I know I’ve been very lucky.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>The leaders are lacking love, and love is lacking leaders.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>I think I look like a chipmunk.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>I’m a believer. I try to be near God, because when I feel that there’s a certain distance, everything begins to look like a blur. It makes the road somewhat smoother. When I feel that I’m without God, I have to make an effort to drag my feet to keep on going.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>The cobra is deadly but mongoose can overcome it. We all have possibillity to defeat prejudiced and resentment in our lives. Fear is the thing that makes us attack, that makes us strike. We must overcome it. We must.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>I have learned that I am an adult already. And to grow with something is sometimes painful. And its great; I don’t say it’s a bad thing – but many things change, and many more responsibilities come, and you have more closure in your life, and more possibilities. It’s just that it’s not as pink as before, but its more interesting.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>I’m lucky to have family around me. Otherwise, I’ll be taking the risk of falling in love with myself. But there are always people close to me who I trust, who will scold me and pull my ears if I need it. Fame isolates people from reality. That happens to many artists, and I don’t want it to happen to me.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>I think my dad is the only Arabic descendent who is an unsuccessful businessman.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>I expect my beloved to be kind, generous, I expect him not to lie so I can look him straight in the eyes, and I expect him to fall in love with me 10 times a day.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>Writing in English was a major challenge. I didn’t want other songwriters to write for me. I wanted to preserve the spirit of my songs in Spanish. I am the same Shakira in English as I am in Spanish.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>I love reading about history. Sometimes, I feel I was born in the wrong era. There was more creativity in the air when people were still discovering new worlds.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>You can laugh, but since I was a child, I knew that I was going to be a well-known singer-songwriter; that was something I had no doubts about. It was almost like a prophecy.</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>People think I like to expose my body. But I don’t. It’s just because the dance moves require it.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>I remember the first time I saw the video “Smells Like Teen Spirit”. I will never forget that day. I just wanted to see Kurt Cobain’s face. I had a feeling he was very cute. But I couldn’t see his face. When I finally did see him, he was even cuter than I imagined!</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>Videos come definitely after the music has been created, but I have always felt, and especially today, that videos are vital in the album process. I think that we live in a very visual era and if you make a mistake with a video, those images will accompany the song forever. There is no way to divorce the image from the music once the video has been filmed and exposed.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>My brain, I believe, is the most beautiful part of my body.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>The worst frustration for a singer is choosing a career in making music and then not being able to make music because you’re always giving interviews.</td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td>It’s not easy to work with me, I recognize that. It’s not easy if those people aren’t perfectionistic as as I am.</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>I admire a person who, for the love of art, is able to take off their clothes in front of a camera. But I’m not capable, I’m too cowardly for that.</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>The worst mistake of a woman is to go to the kitchen, because then she never gets out of there.</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>In 1993, she performed as a contestant at the Viña del Mar International Music Festival (Chile). One of the members of the Jury was Ricky Martin. In 2013, she recalled this experience on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (2003).
