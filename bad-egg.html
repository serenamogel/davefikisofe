This checksum is compared to the stored value, and if they do not match, the game sets the Bad Egg <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Flag (programming)">flag</a> located in an unencrypted portion of the Pokémon data structure.

Pokémon Colosseum and XD do not store a Pokémon's checksum at all, and will only calculate a checksum for a Pokémon when it is traded to the GBA games.

These could be obtained in several ways using the menu storage glitch prior to version 1.1.3:</p><ul><li>Withdrawing a Pokémon from the PC into the party while the player is in a battle or releasing a Pokémon while it is in the middle of evolving will cause a Pokémon whose data is all zeroed out to appear in the party. It is initially displayed as a fainted, male, level 0 Pokémon with 0/0 HP and a blank name. Due to all of its data being zeroed out, it has a species index of 0, no moves, no Ability, 0 <a href=# title="Individual values">IVs</a>, 0 EVs, a Hardy <a href=# title=Nature>Nature</a>, 0 friendship, a <a href=# title="Language of origin">language of origin</a> of 0, a <a href=# title="Strange Ball">Strange Ball</a> as its Poké Ball, a personality value of 0, an encryption constant of 0, and an OT whose name is a blank string, is male, has a Trainer ID of 000000, and has a secret ID of 0000 (which makes it Shiny). Outside of battle, it can be revived by using a <a href=# title="Rare Candy">Rare Candy</a> to level it up to level 1 and then using another Rare Candy, a revival item, or a <a href=# title="Pokémon Center">Pokémon Center</a>. In battle, it will be recalculated as being level 1 with a maximum of 11 HP, so it can be simply be revived by using a revival item. Once revived, it can battle (though it must be switched in, even if it is the first Pokémon in the party). After a battle, all of these Pokémon are moved to the end of the party and have their data zeroed out again. This Pokémon does not appear and cannot be selected in the Boxes interface (so it cannot be released, deposited, placed in the Pokémon Nursery, or be the only Pokémon left in the party), where it can be used to perform a cloning glitch.<a href=#>[4]</a> The Pokémon can be removed by depositing a Pokémon from the party into the PC while the player is in a battle.<a href=#>[5]</a> These glitch Pokémon become Bad Eggs if the game is updated to version 1.1.3 or later.</li><li>Swapping a <a href=# title="Rotom (Pokémon)">Rotom</a> with another Pokémon while using the <a href=# title="Rotom Catalog">Rotom Catalog</a> to change its form will cause the other Pokémon's form to be changed.<a href=#>[6]</a> An affected Pokémon can be changed back to a valid form by repeating the glitch and changing its form back to index number 0 with the option "Light bulb", or another index that corresponds to one of the Pokémon's valid forms.</li></ul><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_other_languages>In other languages</span></h2><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Notes>Notes</span></h2><li id=cite_note-1><span class=mw-cite-backlink><a href=#>↑</a></span> <span class=reference-text>These lines are mistranslated due to the English lines being carried over from Pokémon Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver (where a player could only trade the Pokémon in their party), despite the Japanese lines having been changed from the corresponding lines in those games.
