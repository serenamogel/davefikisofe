Walker was a talented promoter who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-27-bk-baker27-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="often varied" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">often varied</a> the story of how she came up with her products, but we know she was inspired by her own hair loss and a desire to serve the needs of other African American women.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Walker's own hair loss prompted Walker to seek a cure</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 1890s, Walker began to lose her hair. Her work as a laundress <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27791654?read-now=1&seq=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="likely contributed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">likely contributed</a> to this problem, as it exposed her to harsh lye soap, dirt and hot steam. Yet she was far from the only Black woman to experience hair loss at the time. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/100-amazing-facts/madam-walker-the-first-black-american-woman-to-be-a-self-made-millionaire/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Many families" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Many families</a> lived without indoor plumbing, so regular shampooing wasn't possible and problems like lice and pollutants went untreated. Inadequate nutrition also made it difficult to maintain healthy hair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition, many of the products used by Black women, such as a preparation made with ox marrow, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-27-bk-baker27-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="likely damaged" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">likely damaged</a> hair and scalps. Some women wore head wraps to hide their bald patches, but Walker didn't want to follow that path. For one thing, such attire would <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/madam-walker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mark her lower social status" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">mark her lower social status</a> at a time when she sought to elevate herself. Plus, it was natural to desire a full head of healthy hair. So she instead embarked upon a search for a cure for her hair loss.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A product made by another Black woman proved helpful</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Walker was living in Saint Louis when she began trying to solve her hair loss issues. Her brothers worked as barbers in the city, which meant she could turn to them for some hair care know-how. However, they weren't experts on women's hair and scalp diseases, so she also tried out home remedies. In addition, she drew on her experience as a washerwoman and what she had learned about the properties of cleaners like lye soap.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Products she could buy were another resource for Walker, though at the time few items were tailored to the curls and texture of Black women's hair. But Annie Turnbo's Poro line of hair care was different. Turnbo was a Black woman who'd arrived in Saint Louis ahead of the 1904 World's Fair, where she would promote her hair care products and methods. Around 1903, Walker began to use Turnbo's products like the Great Wonderful Hair Grower. Walker's hair problems apparently benefited from this care and she ended up becoming a Poro sales agent.</p><img alt="tin for madame cj walker's wonderful hair grower" title="Tin for Madame C.J.

Walkerâ€™s Wonderful Hair Grower</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Walker eventually came up with her own line of products</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1905, Walker headed to Denver to sell Poro products and continued to pursue her own hair care solutions. She became a cook for pharmacist Edmund L. Scholtz, who may have helped her understand the chemistry of such products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1906, she married Charles Joseph Walker and began to call herself Madam C. J. Walker, a name she held onto after the marriage had ended. By this time, she had developed her own formula to heal scalps and spur hair growth. Walker stopped working for Turnbo and the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company started selling Madam C. J. Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower in 1906. Ingredients included precipitated sulfur, copper sulfate, beeswax, petrolatum (like petroleum jelly), coconut oil and a violet extract perfume to cover the sulfurous smell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Walker <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZqIDAEACAAJ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="once explained" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">once explained</a> the formula of her hair grower came to her in a dream: "God answered my prayer, for one night I had a dream, and in that dream a big Black man appeared to me and told me what to mix up for my hair. Some of the remedy was grown in Africa, but I sent for it, mixed it, put it on my scalp, and in a few weeks my hair was coming in faster than it had ever fallen out. I tried it on my friends; it helped them. I made up my mind I would begin to sell it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet Walker may have simply adapted her former employer's formula. Her creation was called Madam Walkerâ€™s Wonderful Hair Grower, close the name of Turnbo's Wonderful Hair Grower, and both products contained sulfur, used to treat dandruff and other scalp conditions. Turnbo was aggrieved enough to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=qlLXDgAAQBAJ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=advertise class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">advertise</a> that customers should "beware of imitations," but otherwise there was little she could do. As A'Lelia Bundles, Walker's great-great-granddaughter and biographer, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/madam-walker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=noted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">noted</a>: "If you look at medical journals, this mixture of petrolatum and sulfur had been around for a hundred years.â€¦ neither of these women really created this recipe."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She wanted her products to benefit Black women, not change them</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with her hair grower, Walker's early products included Glossine (a pressing oil) and a vegetable shampoo. She urged clients to shampoo more often and to follow her "Walker System," using the hair grower, oil and hot combs, to produce healthier hair. However, though she popularized hot combs that straightened hair, Walker's goal wasn't to alter the appearance of Black women's hair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"Let me correct the erroneous impression held by some that I claim to straighten hair," Walker <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/madam-walker/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="once stated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">once stated</a>. "I deplore such an impression because I have always held myself out as a hair culturist. I grow hair." The Walker product line grew to include creams and soaps, but Walker always stayed focused on the health of her clients' hair and helping women take pride in themselves and their appearance.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGigp66Vo8GwvtJopJqckaJ6pLaMsJilo5Wneqq61Z6lrWWYlrazecKaqZ5loKe8pcHCrao%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmadam-cj-walker-invent-hair-care-products.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmadam-cj-walker-invent-hair-care-products.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmadam-cj-walker-invent-hair-care-products.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmadam-cj-walker-invent-hair-care-products.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmadam-cj-walker-invent-hair-care-products.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmadam-cj-walker-invent-hair-care-products.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stana-katic-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stana-katic-net-worth.html>Stana Katic Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./laura-siegemund-wiki-and-age-how-old-is-she-explore-her-tennis-journey.html>Laura Siegemund Wiki And Age: How Old Is She?
