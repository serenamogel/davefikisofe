<time>12 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Being mistaken for gay is common for famous male entertainers, and Sal Vulcano is no exception. Better known as one-fourth of the comedy troupe “The Tenderloins,” Sal Vulcano is an American improvisational and stand-up comedian. He is famous for being a part of the show “Impractical Jokers,” which debuted on TruTV in December 2011.</p><p>Like many successful male entertainers, fans have also asked, is Sal Vulcano gay? While assuming that he swings that way, some fans have made several gay allegations. These unconfirmed gay claims have caused a stir and left many of his loyal fans in a dilemma.</p><p>However, questions about his personal and love life seem to arouse disagreements between fans that think he is gay and those that unapologetically argue he is straight. Well, is Sal Vulcano from “Impractical Jokers” gay? Here’s all we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-14_10-26-51-fotor-20230814103336.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Led_to_the_Gay_Rumors></span>What Led to the Gay Rumors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The question about Vulcano’s sexuality started after he made a shocking revelation on TV. In one of the episodes of “Impractical Jokers,” aired in 2015, the comedian came out as gay. During the said episode, the “Impractical Jokers” did a talk show skit with their guest, Sally Jessy Raphael, a former daytime talk show host.</p><p>In the said episode, Vulcano said he had something to confess. Shocking the audience, he came clean of something “eating him alive,” coming out as gay in front of everyone. This confession prompted one of the Jokers, James Murray, to come out as gay after seeing Vulcano’s bravery. Vulcano later confessed that he wasn’t gay and only “came out” to give Murray the courage to do so. However, things didn’t end there.</p><p>Like Vulcano, Murray later confessed that he was faking the coming out thing for entertainment, and everything was just part of the skit. However, casual viewers thought it was an honest confession and started spreading rumors about the comedian’s sexuality. That’s how the, is Sal Vulcano gay question started.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Sal_Vulcano_Gay></span>Is Sal Vulcano Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he is not gay. Although he made a shocking revelation on TV about being gay, several reports prove otherwise. In 2019, Sal Vulcano made headlines after he sported what appeared to be a wedding band on his finger during one of his shows in Boston. When someone from the audience pressed about the wedding ring, Vulcano affirmatively replied that he was married. Although his reply answered the: is Sal Vulcano gay question, fans didn’t back down.</p><p>Like Vulcano, it would appear that his friend, Murray, isn’t gay as he announced his engagement to Melyssa Davies in 2019. In addition, their wedding took place in September 2020, effectively silencing any speculations about Murray’s sexuality. Although the Vulcano gay claims have progressively survived, there is no sufficient evidence to back the gay claim up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-14_10-27-03-fotor-20230814103245.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=San_Vulcano_Sexuality_Who_Is_Sal_Vulcanos_Wife></span>San Vulcano Sexuality: Who Is Sal Vulcano’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite being the subject of gay rumors, the famous comedian has always been discreet about his personal life. He never shares details about his relationships with the public, further fueling the: is Sal Vulcano gay question?</p><p>However, rumors about the comedian tying the knot started circulating in December 2019. This marriage rumor started after a Tumblr user claimed to have seen him wearing a wedding band on his left hand during a live show in Boston.</p><p>Consequently, some fans quickly assumed he had tied the knot to his alleged long-time girlfriend, Francesca Muffaletto. However, others were skeptical about the whole thing since Vulcano never publicly confirmed his relationship with Muffaletto. Although the comedian had once mentioned his “terrific” fiancée during his appearance on Robert Kelly’s podcast in June 2019, he didn’t drop any names.</p><p>Vulcano and his alleged long-time girlfriend, Francesca Muffaletto, reportedly tied the knot in a secret wedding ceremony on September 8, 2019. However, there is no direct confirmation of the supposed marriage. But it led to a reduction in gay rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-14_10-26-44-fotor-20230814102920.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Does_Sal_Vulcano_Have_a_Tattoo_of_Jaden_Smith_on_His_Thigh></span>Why Does Sal Vulcano Have a Tattoo of Jaden Smith on His Thigh?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The famous comedian got a tattoo of Jaden Smith’s face on his thigh as a punishment for the “Impractical Jokers” show. For those unfamiliar with the show, it is an American reality TV series that does pranks for entertainment. But what sets the show apart from other prank television shows is that they prank the cast members instead of doing it to clueless bystanders. In addition, they would punish a member who failed to pull off a prank, too.</p><p>While the punishments can be excessive sometimes, like how they got Vulcano to get Jaden Smith’s face tattooed on his thigh in one of the episodes, they are also entertaining. Notably, the cast members are lifelong friends, so they know each other well.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from Vulcano, the other cast members are James Murray, Brian Quinn, and former member Joe Gatto. They call themselves Jokers, and according to reports, they met in high school but went their separate ways after graduating. However, they reconnected after college and formed a comedy ensemble.</p><p>Sal Vulcano is not the only celebrity subjected to gay rumors. Fans of famous “Fast & Furious” action star Vin Diesel also ask, <a href=#>is Vin Diesel gay?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR50pqjZq6lobCius5mnpqxXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-sal-vulcano-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-sal-vulcano-gay.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-sal-vulcano-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-sal-vulcano-gay.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-sal-vulcano-gay.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-sal-vulcano-gay.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./xeon-7500-dell-r810.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./xeon-7500-dell-r810.html>The Nehalem EX Xeon 7500 and Dell R810</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-do-you-use-kawaii-desu-in-a-sentence.html>How do you use kawaii desu in a sentence?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-do-you-use-kawaii-desu-in-a-sentence.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
