Niki was also a consultant for Scuderia Ferrari and the Jaguar Formula One racing team’s team manager for two years.</p><p>Following that, Lauda worked as a commentator for German TV during Grand Prix weekends and served as non-executive chairman of Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport, which he owned 10% of.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts></span>Quick Facts:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Andreas Nikolaus Lauda</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date Of Birth</strong></td><td>22 February 1949</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Demise</strong></td><td>20 May 2019 (aged 70)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Vienna, Austria</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>Austrian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wife</strong></td><td>Marlene Knaus (m. 1976-1991), Birgit Wetzinger (m. 2008)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Mathias, Lukas, Christoph, Mia, and Max.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$200 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=where-is-niki-lauda-wife-birgit-wetzinger-today><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-niki-lauda-wife-birgit-wetzinger-today></span> Where Is Niki Lauda Wife Birgit Wetzinger Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Niki Lauda lived in Vienna, Austria along with his wife Birgit Wetzinger and family before his demise.

While Niki requested a kidney test from his ex-wife, Marlene, the results were inconclusive.</p><p>She cared so much about Niki that she was willing to donate her kidney to him. Later, she requested that her tissue be tested to determine whether she may be a possible donor.</p><p>Niki disputed it, but Birgit claimed for three months that she would finally give her kidney to the ex-BMW M1 Procar Championship champion. Following that, the procedure was a success.</p><p>The racer’s kidney condition was a long-term result of his 1976 German Grand Prix, Nurburgring accident, in which he received severe burns to his head and lungs. As a result, Lauda had to get two kidney transplants.</p><h2 id=niki-lauda-birgit-wetzingers-married-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=niki-lauda-birgit-wetzingers-married-life></span> Niki Lauda & Birgit Wetzinger’s Married Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Birgit Witzenger had just turned 29 when the pair met in 2004, but &nbsp;Niki Lauda was already 59.
