The interview looked back on her career as Gerwig explained some of her favorite directing tricks to make Barbie pop visually as much as it did. She aimed to make the look of the movie, “authentically artificial, really fake. It’s about kids, it’s about playing with toys. The language of play has to be part of it.” She also revealed that the “I’m Just Ken” dance sequence was filmed in just one day.</p><h2 class="css-c65gti efx9mrk7">Celine Song on <i>Past Lives</i></h2><img alt="celine song looks at the camera, she wears a brown, black, and gray jacket over an all black outfit, behind her is a pink background with black logos" data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/celine-song-attends-the-2024-sundance-film-festival-opening-news-photo-1707149667.jpg title="Celine Song at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival in January" width=2480 height=3594 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In an excellent interview <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a46164745/writer-directors-celine-song-and-adele-lim-on-reflecting-the-complexity-of-asian-identity-on-screen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="with Harper’s Bazaar" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">with Harper’s Bazaar</a>, Celine Song spoke about creating and sharing a story that was inspired by her own life experience. “Through Past Lives, I was trying to describe as accurately as I could what it’s like, for me, to be a person,” Song shared in this great conversation. “Then the audience showed up and said, ‘This really reflected the way that I’m a person.

Anatomy of a Fall won the Palme d’Or at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival and secured five Oscar nominations. This film doesn’t tie up as cleanly as an episode of Law & Order, and Triet said she likes writing morally ambiguous stories “precisely because I’m not a judge. Because it isn’t my job to clean up a moral situation. I don’t think I [can] make an edifying film.
