At just 19 years old, Allan is much younger than his sister. First, even as a small child, he was quite interested in athletics. He began riding horses at the age of two and participated in international show jumping competitions.</p><p>When he was five years old, he started playing golf, and professionals were immediately impressed.

Throughout his brief golf career, Allan has won numerous important competitions.</p><p>From 2011 to 2015, he was the winner of the US Kids Golf European Championships. In 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015, he won the United States Kids Golf World Championships. In 2012, after his initial success, he was featured in the renowned Wall Street Journal. He was also included in the 2013 documentary “The Short Game,” which chronicled his golfing exploits.</p><p>He achieved an amazing feat in June and August of 2013, winning the 8-year-old division in three straight European and World Championships. In May 2014, he won the European championship with a commanding lead of 22 strokes.</p><p>He won the 10-year-old classes at the 2015 European World Championship and the 2015 U.S. Kids World Championship with four and nine-stroke leads, respectively. Analysts believe that he will have even greater success in the future after these achievements. His career has so garnered a great deal of media attention. It will be interesting to follow the child’s career.</p><h2>The Siblings Have a Good Relationship</h2><p>Despite being so young, Allan and Anna get along well and are happy together.
