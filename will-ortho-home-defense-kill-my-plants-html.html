<time>19 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span><b>Answer</b></span></p><p>I was under the impression that Ortho home defense for lawn and garden was used to create a barrier around the base of your home to prevent creepy crawlies, such as ants, from entering your home. I was wrong. However, according to the product description, you may spray it on your trees and plants, and it will kill over 200 different sorts of insects, including bees, if you use it properly.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is Ortho Home Defense safe for use in gardens, to put it simply?</h3><p>Ortho Home Defense Bug Spray was accidentally sprayed on me! On their website, it states that you should not plant near other plants. CCS is safe for plants, and according to the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet), it has the same human toxicity rating as water. So go ahead and eat.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is insect spray harmful to plants in the same way?</h3><p>Using bug spray intended for use in gardens, lawns, and landscapes will not harm plants if it is administered correctly. However, the sort of bug spray used may pose a greater hazard to people, animals, and beneficial insects than it does to plants, depending on the formulation.</p><p></p><h3>In addition, is Ortho Home Defense harmful to people in any way?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Human neurotoxicity is a serious problem. Ingestion is poisonous, but in a mild manner. Commercially available bifenthrin (for example, Ortho Home Defense Max) may, however, have hazardous consequences at such quantities since the additional compounds that increase the sustainability either potentiate bifenthrin or are harmful on their own, according to the manufacturer.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Ortho Home Defense capable of being utilized indoors?</h3><p>Designed for indoor and outdoor usage, the Ortho House Defense Max 1.33 Gal. Ready-to-Use Perimeter and Indoor Insect Killer is effective against ants, roaches, spiders, and other pests while also preventing new ones from entering your home.</p><p></p><h3>There were 29 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>How long does Ortho Home Defense provide protection?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>for a period of 12 months</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Ortho Home Defense should be sprayed in the following locations:</h3><p>Set the spray nozzle to the “outside” position. Maintain a distance of 12 inches between the sprayer and the surfaces to be sprayed. Using a 12 inch band around the external perimeter of your property in locations where insects are a reoccurring issue, keep the bugs away. Spray until just a small mist is left, but do not absorb.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to saturate carpet with Ortho Home Defense?</h3><p>In areas where carpet is present, Ortho Home Defense MAX Insect Killer Indoor & Perimeter with Comfort Wand may be used around baseboards to eliminate insects and other pests. Remember to follow the directions on the product package and avoid spraying it too much or too often.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is Ortho Home Defense Effective Against Black Widows?</h3><p>The ready-to-spray Ortho® Home Defense® Insect Killer for Lawn & Landscape is an effective way to eliminate black widow spiders that have set up home in your yard.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to spray Ortho Home Defense within cabinets?</h3><p>If you have a kitchen, you may apply Ortho Home Defense MAX Insect Killer Indoor & Perimeter along the baseboards, but you cannot use it behind cabinet doors. The spray may be used as a crack and crevice treatment in the vacant cabinets surrounding the shelves, and the traps can be used to attract and capture the moths after they have been drawn in and trapped.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>When should I use Ortho Home Defense and how frequently should I use it?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Answer: According to the product label, the Ortho Home Defense MAX Insect Killer Indoor & Perimeter with Comfort Wand may be used as often as necessary to control insects. Outdoor relaxation, on the other hand, is recommended at least once every season.</p><p></p><h3>When should I use a bug spray on the exterior of my house?</h3><p>Pesticides should be applied to your grass, trees and shrubs between the months of February and early March, before the fresh green starts to emerge on the plants. Use a dormant spray to remove aphids, mites, caterpillars, and the eggs of insects laid right before the dormant season to keep your plants healthy and happy.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How does Ortho Home Defense work and what is the active ingredient?</h3><p>Bifenthrin</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><h3>Is it safe to use insecticides inside the house?</h3><p>Pesticides, on the other hand, are not considered “safe.” Boric acid is an example of a substance that is less harmful than others. Pesticides that are organic or designated “non-toxic” are available, however they must frequently be reapplied and take longer to act than conventional pesticides. Organophosphate pesticides are among the most hazardous of the insecticides used inside.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What kind of products does professional pest control use?</h3><p>When it comes to pesticides, permethrin is by far the most frequent active component used by qualified exterminators. It belongs to a vast family of chemical insecticides known as pyrethroids, which are very effective against a wide range of insects. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids are both insecticides that operate to paralyze and ultimately kill a broad range of insects.</p><p></p><h3>Is bifenthrin a chemical that is safe for people to use?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>When consumed by animals, bifenthrin is considered moderately poisonous. The skin of guinea pigs does not become sensitized to bifenthrin (3). Despite the fact that it does not produce inflammation or irritation on human skin, it might induce a tingling feeling that lasts for around 12 hours after application.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What kind of pests does Ortho Home Defense eliminate?</h3><p>Stink bugs, beetles, earwigs, fleas, house centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, silverfish, and ticks are among the 130+ additional insects that are killed by this product.</p><p></p><h3>When it comes to dish soap, is Dawn safe for plants?</h3><p>Dawn liquid dish detergent, at a concentration of around 2 percent, is a somewhat safe alternative to commercial insecticidal soaps, which are developed to kill insects such as aphids, mites, and scale on plants while also keeping them away from the plants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6woKWkXaS%2FtbTOZp%2BopZVisaayxKeqnmWbnrmtecyyZKmkkaPBtHrHraSl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-ortho-home-defense-kill-my-plants-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwill-ortho-home-defense-kill-my-plants-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwill-ortho-home-defense-kill-my-plants-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwill-ortho-home-defense-kill-my-plants-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-ortho-home-defense-kill-my-plants-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-ortho-home-defense-kill-my-plants-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charmeleon-base-set-24.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charmeleon-base-set-24.html>Charmeleon (Base Set 24) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./arm-cortex-a73-artemis-unveiled.html>The Cortex A73 Microarchitecture - The ARM Cortex A73</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./arm-cortex-a73-artemis-unveiled.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
