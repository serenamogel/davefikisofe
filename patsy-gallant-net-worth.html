Along with&nbsp;her older sisters Angeline, Florine, and Ghislaine, she was a member of The Gallant Sisters at the age of five.</p><p>Once her parents relocated to Moncton when she was eight, Gallant began to appear on television, and two years later the group was performing in nightclubs in Montreal.</p><p>She quit the group in 1967 to pursue a solo career, appeared in advertisements, and was a regular on the TV variety shows Discothèque in French and Music Hop in English.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Patsy Gallant career</h2><p>Gallant’s debut record, which she released in 1967, led to performances on several television variety shows.</p><p>She eventually shared the stage with Charles Aznavour at Montreal’s Place des Arts, and soon after that she put together a group of young and gifted artists, including Yves Lapierre, Judi Richards, Denis Forcier, Jean-Guy Chapados, and Ken Owen, who created and wrote in English for her.</p><p>In 1971, Gallant co-starred on the weekly television variety show Smash presented by Télévision de Radio-Canada (the French arm of CBC Television).</p><p>Gallant collaborated on the show with singer-songwriter Christine Charbonneau, who wrote the majority of the lyrics for her two major French albums, both of which were released by Columbia Records. Charbonneau wrote the lyrics for several Gallant songs, including “Tout va trop vite,” “Thank you come again” (French version), “Le lit qui craque,” “Un monde en voie de naître,” and “Un jour comme les autres”.</p><p>As a multilingual artist, Patsy Gallant used to release both the English and French versions of her albums at once. She targeted both the English-speaking countries of Canada and the United States as well as the Francophone markets of Quebec and Europe.</p><p>She released her debut English album, Upon My Own, in September 1972. The sole single from this album to achieve a small hit was “Grab That Ball,” a groovy tune written by Yves Lapierre and Ken Owen, despite the fact that her two French albums were hits in French Canada.</p><p>The tracks “This Old Woman,” “Saturday Weather,” “People Walking Down the Avenue,” and “I’ve Gotta Make It” are also noteworthy from this album (Upon My Own).</p><p>When Gallant collaborated with producer and manager Ian Robertson for her 1976 album, Are You Ready for Love?, she experienced her greatest musical triumph. Gallant and Robertson would collaborate to create five records for Attic Records.</p><p>She has always been fascinated with jazz, soul, and funk music, and in 1973 she began recording disco music (initially in French). Her debut entry, “Daya Dou Doum,” from the album Toi, l’enfant, might be regarded as such.</p><p>She published “Makin’ Love In My Thoughts” (also known as “J’ai le Droit”) in 1975. Gallant released a 7-inch record including a remake of the 1964 Quebec classic “My Pays” by Gilles Vigneault after leaving CBS.</p><p>The English-language Gallant album Would You Give Me Your Love, which included songs like “Every Step of the Way” and “Return to the City,” was released in 1977. She released the English album Patsy! in 1978, which included the disco smash “O Michel,” and the French album Patsy Gallant et Star a year later, both on Attic Records. She scored a success with “Stay a While With Me” (“Aime-moi” in French).</p><p>Patsy Gallant was dubbed “the Canadian disco queen,” yet she never focused solely on it. The hidden tracks on all of her albums from the late 1970s range from West Coast rock in the vein of Steely Dan and blue-eyed soul (“Back to the City” and “It’ll All Come Around”) to Latin-Brazilian jazz (“Te Caliente”) and ballads with Motown influences (“Together Again” and “World of Fantasy”).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Patsy Gallant worth?</h2><p>Gallant has a net worth estimated to be about $5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmYraupYrSiuMuapa1lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpatsy-gallant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpatsy-gallant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpatsy-gallant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpatsy-gallant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpatsy-gallant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpatsy-gallant-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./raveena-tondon-opens-up-about-the-relation-with-stars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./raveena-tondon-opens-up-about-the-relation-with-stars.html>Raveena Tondon opens up about the relation with stars on the sets of Andaz Apna Apna</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lisa-peluso-net-worth-66174.html>Lisa Peluso Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lisa-peluso-net-worth-66174.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
